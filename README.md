# Project README

## Overview

This project is designed to handle authentication and authorization by utilizing various technologies and libraries. The main components include `jsonwebtoken`, `bcryptjs`, restricted routes, role-based access, `React`, `Material-UI`, `Bootstrap`, `React Icons`, `Express`, and `Node`. The primary focus of the project is to provide a robust authentication and authorization service for application development.

## Technologies Used

- **jsonwebtoken**: A library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **bcryptjs**: A library for hashing passwords securely.
- **Restricted Routes**: Implementation of routes with restricted access to enhance security.
- **Role-Based Access**: Utilizes roles to control access to specific functionalities based on user roles.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive and attractive user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework for creating responsive and visually appealing designs.
- **React Icons**: A library providing popular icons for React applications.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **Node**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

## Project Focus

The primary purpose of this project is to establish a secure and reliable authentication and authorization mechanism. The implementation covers the following aspects:

- **User Authentication**: Utilizes `jsonwebtoken` for secure user authentication.
- **Password Hashing**: Implements `bcryptjs` for secure password hashing.
- **Restricted Routes**: Enhances security by restricting access to specific routes.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Utilizes roles to control and manage user access to different features.
- **Frontend Design**: Incorporates `React`, `Material-UI`, `Bootstrap`, and `React Icons` for an appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Server-Side Handling**: Uses `Express` and `Node` for server-side logic.
